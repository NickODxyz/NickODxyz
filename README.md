<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Nick</h1>
<h2 align="center">Frontend Web Developer</h2>

## About Me
I've spent the last 5 years in IT, most recently as a senior analyst for one of the UK's largest retail brands. Whilst I loved my job and the company I worked for, I decided I would like to specialise a lot more in my career.

With my love for all things, IT and the web, I decided Front-End Web Development would be perfect for me. Over the last 3 months I've been self-learning HTML, CSS and JS. I have to say I've loved every minute so far. I have a passion for self-learning, whether it be something I'm familiar with or something completely alien to me.

I've come a long way in these 3 months, from someone who was unsure how to structure a sites HTML semantically to someone who is fully confident that I can reproduce any design put in front of me. I've fallen in love with CSS and the power that comes with understanding how to use it proficiently, to enable you to bring to life any web page - only limited by your imagination.

It is my goal to learn JS to an efficient level where I can understand algorithms and data without the need to look elsewhere for help. I will them begin to implement React into my toolkit and use to add further functionality to my sites.
